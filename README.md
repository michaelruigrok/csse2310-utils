# csse2310-utils
A collection of scripts I found personally useful while I was doing the
course. 

<command>--help</command> will give you help for pretty much all of them
Use at your own risk, probably a good idea to look at the code and make sure
it's not doing anything nasty.

If you have any features you want added, just give me a buzz on @cramel for the
UQCS slack, or ruigrok.michael@gmail.com

Or at least that's how it was when I was taking the course. Still, I might be
able to help you out with some stuff if you're trying to do something and it's
not working out, but keep in mind I don't have any access to the assessment
tools or assignments or anything.
